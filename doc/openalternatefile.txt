INTRODUCTION

This plugin is intended to help you find the alternate test or production file faster.
When you are editing the production code, the plugin will open the spec file of it and vice-versa.

The plugin has a limitation because it works under a convention: the spec and production code has the 
same name (almost - see USAGE).

USAGE

If you are working in a webapp using phoenix framework, this plugin will only work to versions starting at 1.3 of 
phoenix.

USAGE

`<leader>.` is the way to go.

Let's say that you are editing the my_file_spec.exs, when you type in normal mode `<leader>.` the plugin 
will alternate to the file my_file.ex. If you type `<leader>.` again, you will be back to my_file_spec.exs.

It works to cucumber too (white-bread flavor).

When you are editing your my_awesome.feature and type `<leader>.` the plugin brings you the my_awesome_contexts.exs
and vice-versa.
